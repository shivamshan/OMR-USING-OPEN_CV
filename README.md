# OMR-USING-OPEN_CV
## This project deals with the development of a **OMR** system for grading a _BUBBLE SHEET_ of _MULTI CHOICE QUESTIONS._
I have made use of open_cv to create a program that reads in an image of the OMR sheet and grades it on basis of the Answer Key entered.
</br>
The program draws a **red circle** around the option that is coorect but not chosen and draws a **green circle** around the option that was actually correct and
was correctly chosen by the person giving the test.</br>
Also the program draws a **yellow circle** around the correct option if the question was not answered.
</br>

## The orignal uploaded image with the final output:-
